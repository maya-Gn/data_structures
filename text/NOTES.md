*** TODO'S: Orderd by page numbers and or chapters ***
0.  
    1. Remember to do a pen/paper trace of the method getHeight in BinaryNode.java.
1.  *** Very Important To Review ***
    * Page 735 up to and including Page 753 {very import to review}.
        Page 741 provide a recursive and and iterative implementations of the `remove()` method. Implement them both.
    * ...
2.  *** Good To Review ***
    * Chapter 9 using a stack instead of recursion(try to do first)
    * Page 697 Compare the iterator version and iterative method
    * ...
3.  *** If Time Permits ***
    * Page 700 and onwards. On file systems using general trees.


*** Currently doing: ***
0.  
    1. Page 697 iterator's for traversal orders.
        0. BinaryTree InorderIterator errors.[check]
        1. BinaryTree PreorderIterator.[`inProgress` -> need to get paper]
        2. BinarySearTree.java errors[`inProgress` -> The inner classes ReturnObject and NodePair were left as exercises.]
