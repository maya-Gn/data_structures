**Will probably be using this file to write notes going forward**

1. ## Section 18.4 EFFICIENCY: Designing with inheritance in mind!!!

**TODO'S: Orderd by page numbers and or chapters**
0.  
    1. Remember to do a pen/paper trace of the method getHeight in BinaryNode.java.
1.  **Very Important To Review**
    * Page 735 up to and including Page 753 {very import to review}.
        Page 741 provide a recursive and and iterative implementations of the `remove()` method. Implement them both.
    * How to override the equals method.
    **In the book Introduction to Programming in Java, look up: a)filter, b)Transformation. Also see the lone coder 2d affine transformatio video. c) Graphics codex. A) `Morphing`**
    * ...
2.  **Good To Review**
    * Chapter 9 using a stack instead of recursion(try to do first)
    * Page 697 Compare the iterator version and iterative method
    * Section 18.4 EFFICIENCY: Designing with inheritance in mind.
        * When you make methods in the base class protected make them final so that its subclass(es) wont be able to override those methods.
    * ...
3.  **If Time Permits**
    * Page 700 and onwards. On file systems using general trees.
4. **Notations to know**
   * public class X[T extends Comparable ? super T] means that the class that T represents must implement the interface Comparable.


**Currently doing:**
0.  
    1. Page 697 iterator's for traversal orders.
        0. BinaryTree InorderIterator errors.[check]
        1. BinaryTree PreorderIterator.[`inProgress` -> need to get paper]
        2. BinarySearTree.java errors[check]
